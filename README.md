# jito-relayer
Jito Relayer acts as a transaction processing unit (TPU) proxy. 
It filters and verifies transactions for multiple authenticated validators on a separate server to ensure validators can devote resources to executing transactions.

See https://jito-foundation.gitbook.io/mev/jito-relayer/running-a-relayer for setup and usage instructions.
